The original csv files are too large to upload to github.

- substition_data_18_csv.csv stores the substitution data in season 18-19.

- analysis.py stores the basic csv io functions. It generates the graph information
and stores them in sub-18.json.

- sub-18.json stores the graph information

- analysis18.py directly create graphs from sub-18.json and did basic anaylsis on
the graphs.

- visulization stores the graphs for each team in season 18-19. An edge is created
if there are more than 20 substitutions.
